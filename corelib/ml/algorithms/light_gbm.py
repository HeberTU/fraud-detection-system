            objective: str
                Name of the loss function.
            num_iterations: int:
                Number of boosting iterations.
            max_depth: int
                Limit the max depth for tree model. This is used to deal with
                over-fitting when data is small.
            num_leaves: int
                Max number of leaves in one tree
            learning_rate: float
                Shrinkage rate
            feature_fraction: float
                LightGBM will randomly select a subset of features on each
                iteration (tree) if feature_fraction is smaller than 1.0. For
                example, if you set it to 0.8, LightGBM will select 80% of
                features before training each tree.
            bagging_fraction: float
                Like feature_fraction, but this will randomly select part of
                 data without resampling
            min_gain_to_split: float
                The minimal gain to perform split
            min_data_in_leaf: int
                Minimal number of data in one leaf. Can be used to deal with
                over-fitting
            lambda_l1: float
                L1 regularization
            lambda_l2: float

            num_threads: int
                Number of threads for LightGBM
            verbose: int
                Controls the level of LightGBMâ€™s verbosity.
            threshold: float
                Probability threshold to evaluate true when predicting.
